Building this repository requires Visual Studio 2019 Community Edition.
It requires the current VS C/C++ and MFC components.

This builld is 32 bit for compatiibility with old Windows versions.
The 32 bit build is fully compatible with X64 Windows.

Windows X64 build capability is provided, but it is provisional
because there are many compiler warnings related to casts between
integer variables of different size.  This is a work in progress.
